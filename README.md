# CLF-C02-quiz

## This project is just for educational purposes 

Used https://github.com/Ditectrev/Amazon-Web-Services-AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner-CLF-C02-Practice-Tests-Exams-Questions-Answers README.md file and parsing it to questions on the client side

The original Exam-Question author has his own website with exam practicing, but it's way too slow and uses redundant database.
My static website parses on the client side and working very fast.
