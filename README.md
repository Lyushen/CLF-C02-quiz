# CLF-C02-quiz

## This project is just for educational purposes 

A collection of readme.md files from https://github.com/Ditectrev repositories, pre-converted to JSON and used local static website storage to retrieve questions for the quiz web app.

The original author's web application is overwhelmed with redundant functionality/framework and as a result, significant performance issues that are not allowing easy practice on the questions.
This static website uses preparsed JSON files and works very fast.
